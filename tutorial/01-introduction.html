<p>Clack is a web application environment on Common Lisp, inspired by Python's WSGI, Ruby's Rack, and Perl's Plack. By abstracting HTTP into simple APIs, Clack enables your web applications to be portable and be reusable.</p>

<p>If you are familiar with web application development, you may have noticed the reason why this type of software is so important--web applications are in beta forever.</p>

<h3>Enlargement of systems</h3>

<p>It means we have to improve our applications on daily basis. In the process of the improvement, it is common that you have to add features which are completely out of your consideration during its initial design phase. Web applications will be enlarged.</p>

<p>In this type of situation, it is really hard or even impossible for you to add new functionalities into your application if you built it as one big rock which doesn't have good layer or modular architecture. This is why components of your application should be loosely coupled so as to make their dependencies as clear and simple as possible.</p>

<h3>Technologies change fast</h3>

<p>On top of that, there is another issue. The Web evolves fast. Most technologies are likely to be changed or replaced within a few years.</p>

<p>This fact makes the problem unavoidable regardless of how you wrote "your" programs carefully to avoid it. All software gets stale everyday. Your web server software will have become old-fashioned just a few years later. Your web framework may be not maintained anymore in that future. Same applies to the libraries you are using in your application. It is difficult for you to make your source code up to date with the times if your application is tightly coupled to other software.</p>

<h3>What Clack solves</h3>

<p>Clack was developed to solve this problem. Clack works like "glue" to compose a web application. Actually, Clack is not a web application framework but a collection of modular components, which are so loosely coupled that you can easily replace any of them independently.</p>

<p>Clack is an abstraction layer for both HTTP and web servers. This allows you to ignore the difference over backends of your system. As web applications built on Clack are independent form your current choice of backend, you can run the same code on other web servers just by modifying your application a little bit.</p>

<p>I should not explain all about Clack in this one chapter, but rather provide additional information that helps you check how trustworthy Clack is: at least if it's worth sparing your time to learn the outline.</p>

<h3>Clack has been stable</h3>

<p>All features of the core of Clack were already implemented in the first official release in June, 2011. Since then, no serious bug has been found and nothing harmful to backward compatibility has been introduced into it.</p>

<h3>Continuous improvements</h3>

<p>We release Clack <a href="https://github.com/fukamachi/clack/tags">every month</a>. Clack has been and will be improved continuously through this process: the features of Clack has been strengthened constantly, and even in case of our finding a severe bug in the future, you can expect that it will be fixed at latest by next month for sure.</p>

<h3>Well-documented</h3>

<p>Most functions, variables and macros in Clack have docstrings. Even packages have. We strongly believe all entities in sources should be documented except that they are truly self-explanatory.</p>

<p>We provide the documentation also in HTML format at <a href="http://clacklisp.org/doc/">http://clacklisp.org/doc/</a>.</p>

<h3>Well-tested</h3>

<p>The reason why Clack had only a few bugs so far is plenty of quality unit tests. There are 173 tests currently. The test coverage has been kept over 70% since its first official release.</p>

<p>All releases have passed the test suite on three CL implementations: Clozure CL, SBCL, and CLISP. You can check the current status at <a href="http://ci.clacklisp.org/">http://ci.clacklisp.org/</a>.</p>
