<p>Clack is a web application environment on Common Lisp, inspired by Python's WSGI, Ruby's Rack, and Perl's Plack. By abstracting HTTP into simple APIs, Clack enables your web applications to be portable and be reusable.</p>

<p>If you are familiar with web application development, you may notice why these types of software are so important: web applications are in beta forever.</p>

<h3>Enlargement of systems</h3>

<p>It means we have to improve our applications on daily basis. In the process of the improvement, it is common that you have to add features which are completely out of your consideration at the time of the design process. Web applications will be enlarged.</p>

<p>In this type of situation, it is really hard or even imposibble for you to add new functionalities into your application if you built it as one big rock which has no layer or modular architecture. This is why components of your application should be loosely coupled so as to make their dependencies as clear as possible.</p>

<h3>Technologies change fast</h3>

<p>Besides that, there is another issue. The Web evolves fast. Probably most technologies will be changed or replaced within a few years.</p>

<p>This fact makes the problem unavoidable regardless of how you wrote "your" programs carefully to avoid it. All software gets old day by day. Your web server software will have become old-fashioned just a few years later. Your web framework may be not maintained anymore in that future. Same applies to the libraries you are using in your application. It is difficult for you to change your source code along the times if your application is tightly coupled to other software.</p>

<h3>What Clack solves</h3>

<p>Clack was developed to solve this problem. Clack works like "glue" to compose a web application. Actually, Clack is not a web application framework but a collection of modular components, which are so loosely coupled that you can easily replace them independently.</p>

<p>Clack is an abstraction layer for both HTTP and web servers. This allows you to ignore the difference of backends of your system. As web applications built on Clack are independet form your current choice of backends, you can run the same code on different web servers just by rewriting your application a little bit.</p>

<p>I shouldn't explain all about Clack in this one chapter, but rather leave additional information that helps you check how trustworthy Clack is: at least if it's worth sparing your time to learn the detail.</p>

<h3>Clack seems stable</h3>

<p>All features of the core of Clack were already implemented in the first official release in June, 2011. Since then, no serious bug has been found and anything that is harmfull for backward compatibility has not been introduced.</p>

<h3>Continuous improvements</h3>

<p>We release Clack <a href="https://github.com/fukamachi/clack/tags">every month</a>. There were various kind of changes in them, but, what I really want to say is, Clack has been and will be improved continuously through this process: the features of Clack has been strengthened steadily, and even in case of we find a fatal bug in the future, you can expect it will be fixed by next month.</p>

<h3>Well-documented</h3>

<p>Most functions, variables and macros in Clack have docstrings. Even packages have. Because we think all entities in sources need documentation for them except the case that they are really self-explanatory.</p>

<p>We also provides them in HTML format at <a href="http://clacklisp.org/doc/">http://clacklisp.org/doc/</a>.</p>

<h3>Well-tested</h3>

<p>The reason why only a few bugs were found so far in Clack is its plentiness of unit tests. It has 173 tests currently. The test coverage has been kept more than 70% (I want to improve it more, though).</p>

<p>Of course, all releases have passed the test suite on three CL implementations: Clozure CL, SBCL, and CLISP. You can check the current status at <a href="http://ci.clacklisp.org/">http://ci.clacklisp.org/</a>.</p>
